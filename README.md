Welcome to the Building AI Agents Workshop!

During this workshop, you will learn from scratch how to build AI agentic workflows and agents.

## Prerequisites

Before the workshop, please complete these steps:

1. Install Python. The recommended approach is to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
2. Clone this repository, open it in a terminal, and run `uv sync` to install the dependencies.
3. Create a free [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) account.
4. Create a free [SERPAPI](https://serpapi.com/) account.
5. Open the `labs/0_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb` and make sure that you can run the code.

## Materials

Right now the repository only contains a jupyter notebook to verify that you have the prerequisites installed. The rest of the contents for the workshop will be uploaded to this repository on June 15th, 2025.
